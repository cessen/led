Led
===

Led is a simple text editor with both a console and GUI interface.

The long-term goals of Led are to be a scriptable, cross-platform code editor that you can take with you wherever you go.  It's a long ways off from that at the moment, however.

Other projects that inspire the general direction of Led include [Zed](http://zedapp.org) and [Vim](http://www.vim.org).
