Led
===

Led is a simple console-based text editor.

The long-term goals of Led are to be a scriptable, cross-platform code editor with both a console and GUI interface that you can take with you wherever you go.  It's a long ways off from that at the moment, however.

Other projects that inspire the general direction of Led include [Zed](http://zedapp.org), [Vim](http://www.vim.org), and [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).
